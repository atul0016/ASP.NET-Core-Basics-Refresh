# ASP.NET-Core-Basics-Refresh
This repository contains the code that goes with set of blog post on the basics of of ASP.NET Core where can be found [here](http://www.elanderson.net/category/asp-net-core/asp-net-basics/).

## Expanded
This repo is a fresh start with the same idea as the [ASP.NET Core Basics](https://github.com/elanderson/ASP.NET-Core-Basics), but with a fresh start at the release of ASP.NET Core 3.0. Over time this repo should give a jumping off point to experiment with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) from inside the same soultion using different projects for each framework.
